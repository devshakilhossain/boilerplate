A modern, lightweight WordPress plugin boilerplate for developers to build clean, scalable, and maintainable plugins.

== Description ==
WordPress Boilerplate Plugin is a developer-focused starter framework for building professional WordPress plugins.
It provides a clean folder structure, OOP-based architecture, proper namespacing, and secure defaults. This boilerplate is ideal for developers who want to avoid repetitive setup and focus directly on building features.
The plugin does not add any frontend or admin functionality by default. It is intentionally minimal and designed to be extended.

== Features ==
Clean and modular folder structure
Object-oriented programming (OOP) architecture
Namespaced classes to avoid conflicts
Secure by default (ABSPATH checks)
Easy to extend and customize
Suitable for REST APIs, AJAX, shortcodes, and admin pages
Developer-friendly and readable codebase

== Installation ==
Upload the plugin folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory, or install it via the Plugins screen.
Rename the plugin folder and main plugin file as needed.
Update the plugin header information.
Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress.

== Usage ==
This boilerplate is intended as a starting point for development.
You can extend it to:
Register shortcodes

No functionality is added automatically.

== Customization ==
Before using this boilerplate in production, rename:
Plugin name
Text domain
PHP namespaces
Class names
Constants
This ensures uniqueness and prevents conflicts with other plugins.
